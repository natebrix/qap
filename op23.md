This talk is in appreciation for my PhD adviser, Kurt Anstreicher. 

In this talk, I use machine learning to improve the performance of algorithms for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), 
a notoriously hard combinatorial optimization problem. Branch-and-bound algorithms are widely used to find provably optimal solutions for QAP. In
this talk, I show how ML can be used to obtain better branching strategies. I make three primary claims:

1. Branching is a primary performance driver for branch-and-bound algorithms for the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP).â€‹
2. Branching rules obtained by learning-to-rank methods can outperform traditional hard-coded rules.
3. This approach can likely be used for most QAP bounds, and for problems beyond QAP.

Though the talk is self-contained, it may be hard to follow if you are not familiar with branch-and-bound algorithms for QAP. Luckily for you,
I have written about QAP occasionally over the past twenty years. [In this blog post, I discussed branch-and-bound algorithms for QAP in a playful way.](https://nathanbrixius.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/quadratic-assignment-problems-for-bartenders/)
You can read more about various aspects of branch-and-bound for QAP, and some fun applications, [here](https://nathanbrixius.wordpress.com/category/qap/).

The code that supports this talk is available [here](https://github.com/natebrix/qap). I regret that I cannot guarantee that I will answer any
questions about this code, given other obligations.
